- send if tx is new; blacklist if followee sends same tx twice or stays mum for 5 rounds. Score - 81

Tests for this assignment involve your submitted miner competing with a number of different types of malicious miners

Running test with parameters: numNodes = 100, p_graph = 0.1, p_malicious = 0.3, p_txDistribution = 0.01, numRounds = 10
